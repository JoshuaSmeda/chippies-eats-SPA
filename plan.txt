Flask application with a sqlite backend for persistance across application reboots

Build a mobile application similar to this: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/examples/sign-in/

Needs to be only accessible via certain source IPs since making a login page is out of the scope.

Needs to post to Slack when submissions are available -- in #general chat

Mobile app needs to ask for the users name and their order (from a drop down menu)

Needs to use jquery to advise the user if the order was placed successfully, or not and the reason as to why it failed.


===

The above has been completed successfully. Need to improve on the following:


Need to implement a class to handle DB queries without repeating code.
Need to build automation testing
Need to deploy a wsgi application (gunicorn as a example).
Need to implement additional CF firewall rules and only allow access from office breakout.
